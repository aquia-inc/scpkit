3.  If possible, provide examples of how the feature could be used, including code snippets or mockups.
4.  If applicable, list any potential drawbacks or limitations of implementing the feature.

Remember that the more detailed and specific your feature request is, the easier it will be for us to evaluate and potentially implement it.

### Pull Requests

We follow a trunk-based development model for our codebase. This means that all changes should be made in short-lived feature branches and merged directly into the `main` branch through pull requests. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth and efficient contribution process:

1.  Create a new branch from the latest `main` branch for each new feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the changes being made.
2.  Keep your changes focused and limited to a single feature or bug fix. If you find another issue while working on your branch, create a new issue and a separate branch for it.
3.  Commit your changes using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard. This helps maintain a clean and readable commit history. Your commit messages should follow this format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`. For example:
    ```
    fix(auth): resolve login failure due to incorrect token validation
    ```
4.  Sign your commits using GPG. This adds an extra layer of security and ensures the authenticity of your contributions. Follow the [GitHub documentation on signing commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) to set up and use GPG.
5.  Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your changes are up-to-date with the latest `main` branch. Rebase your branch if necessary.
6.  Open a pull request, and provide a clear and concise title and description that follows the Conventional Commits standard. Include any relevant issue numbers in the description by using keywords like "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123".
7.  Request a review from one or more project maintainers or collaborators. Be prepared to address any feedback, suggestions, or requested changes.
8.  Once your pull request is approved and all tests have passed, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the `main` branch.

Please note that pull requests that do not follow the guidelines or are incomplete may be closed without explanation. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a high-quality codebase.

### Coding Standards

Adhering to a consistent set of coding standards is crucial for maintaining a clean, readable, and maintainable codebase. By following these guidelines, you help ensure that scpkit remains a high-quality project that is easy to understand, modify, and extend.

Here are some general guidelines for writing code that conforms to the project's coding standards:

1.  Follow the project's style guide: Familiarize yourself with the project's style guide, which outlines conventions for naming, indentation, code organization, and other aspects of the code's appearance. If a specific style guide is not provided, follow widely-accepted community standards for the programming language being used.

2.  Write clean and readable code: Keep your code simple, clear, and concise. Use descriptive variable and function names, add comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code, and break down large functions or classes into smaller, more manageable pieces.

3.  Optimize for performance and security: Write code that is efficient, secure, and avoids common pitfalls and vulnerabilities. Be mindful of performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and security risks when designing and implementing your solutions.

4.  Document your code: Include comments and docstrings to explain the purpose, functionality, and usage of your code. This helps other contributors understand your code and makes it easier for them to maintain and extend it.

5.  Stay consistent with existing code: When making changes or additions to the codebase, try to match the style, structure, and conventions of the existing code. This ensures that the codebase remains coherent and easy to navigate.

6.  Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle: Avoid duplicating code and logic across the codebase. Instead, refactor and reuse code whenever possible to minimize maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies.

To contribute code that follows the project's coding standards:

1.  Create a new branch from the latest `main` branch.
2.  Make your changes or additions to the code, following the guidelines above.
3.  Commit your changes using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard, as described in the [Pull Requests](#pull-requests section.
4.  Sign your commits using GPG, as described in the [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) section.
5.  Open a pull request with a clear and concise title and description, following the Conventional Commits standard.
6.  Request a review from one or more project maintainers or collaborators.

By adhering to the project's coding standards, you help create a strong foundation for the continued growth and success of scpkit. Thank you for your commitment to maintaining a high-quality codebase!

### Testing

Thorough and consistent testing is essential for maintaining the stability, reliability, and security of scpkit. By contributing tests, you help ensure that the project remains robust and resistant to bugs, regressions, and vulnerabilities. Here are some guidelines for writing and contributing tests:

1.  Follow the testing framework and conventions: Familiarize yourself with the testing framework, tools, and conventions used in the project. Write tests that are consistent with the existing test suite and follow best practices.
2.  Write tests for new features and bug fixes: When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, make sure to include tests that cover the changes. This helps prevent regressions and ensures that the changes work as intended across different environments and configurations.
3.  Improve existing tests: If you find existing tests that are incomplete, unclear, or lacking in coverage, feel free to improve them. This may involve refactoring, adding new test cases, or improving test descriptions.
4.  Ensure tests are reliable and maintainable: Write tests that are easy to understand, maintain, and update. Avoid using hard-coded values, magic numbers, or brittle logic that may cause tests to fail unexpectedly or become difficult to maintain.
5.  Run tests locally: Before submitting a pull request, run the entire test suite locally to ensure that your changes do not introduce new test failures or break existing functionality.

To contribute tests, follow the same process as for code contributions:

1.  Create a new branch from the latest `main` branch.
2.  Add or modify tests as needed.
3.  Commit your changes using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard, with a `test` type in the commit message. For example:
    ```
    test(auth): add test cases for login failure scenarios
    ```
4.  Sign your commits using GPG, as described in the [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) section.
5.  Open a pull request with a clear and concise title and description, following the Conventional Commits standard.
